      <h3>Reviews</h3>
      <p><strong>Charades! &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; Schuuu</strong><br /> Like all the best iPhone apps, Charades is a simple idea executed to perfection. So easy to use, and intuitively designed that even my technophobe family understood how to use if without being prompted. This app takes all the pressure out of coming up with something to mime, worth every penny.</p>
      <p><strong>Hilarious! &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; Calamity Kate</strong><br /> Charades is lovely and cute and brilliantly funny. The app is lovely to look at, simple to use and full of great Charades to act out. Brilliant for parties!</p>
