      		<h2>Release Notes</h2>
                  <h3>v1.9.1</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Bug Fix: Fixed crash when picking colours for the opaque background fill using the grayscale colour picker.</li>
                    <li>Bug Fix: Colour values can now be directly entered into the text boxes on the colour picker without dismissing the popover in Status Magic.</li>
                  </ul>
      		<h3>v1.9</h3>
      		<ul>
      		  <li>Added support for auto detecting whether the status bar for an iOS 7 screenshot should be light or dark content. Select "iOS 7 (Auto Detect Content)" to switch use this feature.</li>
      		  <li>Added support for adding an opaque fill behind iOS 7 status bars. This won't look good if your app has blurred content behind the bar but for apps with flat/tinted status bars this should work well without having to capture screenshots with SDScreenshotCapture.</li>
      		  <li>Bug Fix: Light content -> Dark Content & Dark Content -> Light Content. Oops...</li>
      		  <li>Bug Fix: iOS 6 tinted status bars no longer render tinted on iPad screenshots, regardless of settings. The device does not support doing this and we match that now.</li>
      		</ul>
      		<h3>v1.8</h3>
      		<ul>
      		  <li>iOS 7 support. Status Magic now fully supports the look and feel of the new iOS 7 status bar.</li>
      		  <li>Added support for showing a VPN connection on the status bar.</li>
      		  <li>Added a single "Export" button overlaid on the selected screenshot.</li>
      		  <li>Bug Fix: Made the control labels on the settings popover more consistent. (Removed the word "Display" before some options)</li>
      		  <li>Bug Fix: Screenshots are now displayed in the correct order when multiple screenshots are opened at the same time.</li>
      		  <li>Bug Fix: Screenshots can now be dragged on to the top half of the application window to open them as well as the bottom gallery area.</li>
      		  <li>Bug Fix: When opening a screenshot it is automatically selected after being opened.</li>
				<li>Bug Fix: Progress bar should no longer be displayed when reordering screenshots.</li>
      		</ul>
      		<h3>v1.7</h3>
      		<ul>
      		  <li>Added support for adding custom carrier text to exported screenshots.</li>
      		  <li>Added support for translucent status bars, see <a href="http://shinydevelopment.com/status-magic/translucent-screenshots-help">the help page</a> for more information on preparing screenshots for this feature.</li>
      		  <li>Slight visual tweaks to exported screenshots to even more closely match iOS.</li>
      		  <li>Added a Close All button to the status bar.</li>
      		</ul>
      		<h3>v1.6</h3>
      		<ul>
      		  <li>Added support for replacing the status bars for Non-Retina (1x) screenshots for iPhone 3.5 inch (320x480), iPhone 4 inch (320x568) and iPad (1024x768) which should make replacing status bars on marketing images or images intended for a web site much easier!</li>
      		  <li>Added support for resizing Retina screenshots to Non-Retina (2x to 1x) as part of the export process.</li>
      		  <li>Added support for importing a directory structure of screenshots. Useful if you already have all of your 		screenshots stored in an existing directory structure. This probably affects you if you have localized screenshots!</li>
      		  <li>Added support for exporting files back to their original locations (overwriting the original files). Useful if you are working with lots of screenshots in a directory structure as mentioned above.</li>
      		  <li>Paths for images displayed in the bar at the bottom of the window now show a tilde for any image under the users home directory.</li>
      		  <li>Bug Fix: When exporting using generated file names Status Magic now distinguishes between iPhone 3.5 inch and iPhone 4 inch images in the file name.</li>
      		  <li>Bug Fix: Custom time text no longer attempts to word wrap, oops!</li>
      		  <li>Bug Fix: Reordering of screenshots in the lower panel now works again!</li>
      		</ul>
      		<h3>v1.5</h3>
      		<ul>
      		  <li>Initial public release</li>
      		</ul>
      		<h3>v1.0</h3>
      		<ul>
      		  <li>Not released to public (<a href="http://nsbrief.com/78-dave-verwer/">why?</a>)</li>
      		</ul>
