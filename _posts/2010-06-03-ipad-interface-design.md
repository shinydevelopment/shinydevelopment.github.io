excerpt: I had the pleasure of speaking at the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ipadliverpool.eventbrite.com/">iPad at the CUC</a> event last night in Liverpool and as promised am posting the slides here from my talk. I am not sure the slides make a whole lot of sense without the words that accompanied them but hopefully they will provide some visual reminders if you attended the talk. I wish I could have talked for longer last night, there is so much more in the usability study that I referenced that and so many other apps I would have liked to showcase but there just wasn't time in 20 minutes.

I had the pleasure of speaking at the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ipadliverpool.eventbrite.com/">iPad at the CUC</a> event last night in Liverpool and as promised am posting the slides here from my talk.

You can <a href="http://shinydev.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-files/ipad-interface-design-slides.pdf">download the slides as a PDF file</a> or if you prefer, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/daveverwer/ipad-interface-design">view them on SlideShare</a>.

I am not sure the slides make a whole lot of sense without the words that accompanied them (I am not sure they made a huge amount of sense <strong>with</strong> the words, come to think of it!) but hopefully they will provide some visual reminders if you attended the talk! I wish I could have talked for longer last night, there is so much more in the usability study that I referenced that and so many other apps I would have liked to showcase but there just wasn't time in 20 minutes.

The two documents that I quoted in the talk are the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/General/Conceptual/iPadHIG/Introduction/Introduction.html">iPad Human Interface Guidelines</a> from Apple and the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nngroup.com/reports/mobile/ipad/">Nielsen Norman study on iPad Usability</a>.

I would also recommend a couple of blogs if you are interested in this subject, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ignorethecode.net/blog/">Ignore the Code</a> by Lukas Mathis which is an insightful look at all sorts of usability and interface problems, but quite often covers the iPhone and iPad and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://wellplacedpixels.com/">Well Placed Pixels</a> which is simply a stream of gorgeous software for the iPhone and iPad, definitely worth a look.

Thanks to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://pixel-lab.co.uk/">Pixel Lab</a> and <a href="http://www.visionandmedia.co.uk/">North West Vision &amp; Media</a> for organising the event and asking me to speak.
