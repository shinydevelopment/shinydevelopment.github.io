We have been working with both of these for a number of months and are excited to announce that **all of our [training courses](/iphone-training/) have been fully updated for both iOS 8 and Xcode 6**. All of the slides, lab notes and sample code have been updated to be compatible with the new tools included in the Xcode 6 release.

Xcode 6 is available [from Apple for free](http://developer.apple.com/xcode/). You should [book on an iOS development training course](/iphone-training/) and get yourself up to speed.
