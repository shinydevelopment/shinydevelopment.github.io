Unlike Lord Sugar, we don't have £250,000 to invest in your business, but we **are** looking to hire an apprentice to work with us developing iOS applications. We are offering a one year apprenticeship where you will be fully immersed in learning to create the best iOS software around.

### What will you be doing?

* Working on brand new apps that we are developing.
* Performing maintenance and updates to our existing apps.
* Learning about everything new in iOS in order to help develop the demo apps and samples that we use for our training courses.

Plus, you will be a guinea pig for all of the new training we are developing so there are even more opportunities to learn there! At the end of the year you should emerge as a fully fledged iOS ninja to potentially take a full time job working with us or step out into freelancing or other iOS roles!

### What can we offer you?

* The opportunity to learn everything there is to know about iOS development and get experience working on real apps. We have been developing with iOS since the SDK was first released and have been teaching other people to do it for over 2 years now so we have a pretty good grasp of how to transfer that knowledge to you!
* A relaxed, friendly work environment at the [Daresbury Innovation Centre](http://www.daresburysic.co.uk). This is an on-site position, how else would you do all of that learning from us?
* The [best computer in the world](http://www.apple.com/mac/) to work on.

No Objective-C or iOS development experience is strictly necessary for this position although of course anything you do know in advance would be to your benefit. However you should be confident with some kind of modern, object-oriented language such as Java, C#, Ruby, Python, etc... Of course, you should also be super keen to learn as much about iOS development as you can.

Salary will be dependent on experience.
