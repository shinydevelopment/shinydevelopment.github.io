I just got back this morning from the wonderful [iOS Dev UK](http://www.iosdevuk.com/) conference in sunny Aberystwyth (yes, it really was sunny!). At the conference I was asked to present a review of the year in iOS Development and a few people asked me to put my slides online when I got back. So here they are!

I know it isn't the end of the year but when I suggested that the conference be moved to fit the title of the presentation it didn't go down as well as I had hoped. So, I took the year as September to September aligning the year on iOS release dates and made it fit that way!

Thanks again to the organisers of [iOS Dev UK](http://www.iosdevuk.com/), it was a fantastic conference again this year and I hope to be back in 2014!
