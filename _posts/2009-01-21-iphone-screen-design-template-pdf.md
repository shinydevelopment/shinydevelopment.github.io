title: iPhone Screen Design Template PDF
author: Dave Verwer
excerpt: This is something that I find useful when designing iPhone projects and so I thought I would share it with you all! Print a few copies of this PDF out and draw screen designs all over them, it is approximately the same physical size as the phone itself and includes plenty of whitespace around the edges for notes.
