It is always a pleasure to be asked to speak at an event and I have recently been asked to get involved and do a short talk at the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ipadliverpool.eventbrite.com/">&#8220;iPad at the C.U.C.&#8221;</a> event being held in Liverpool this week.

I am going to be speaking on iPad application design so here is a sneak peek of the first slide in my presentation, and the theme of the talk:
