title: Being embarrased about shipping v1.0
author: Dave Verwer
excerpt: Are Apple ever embarrassed about the v1.0 products they ship? Absolutely, but they are embarrassed about lacking features, not quality. Shipping a product is a huge task to take on and compromises are always going to be made but I believe Apple take the right choices here to still ship amazing products while making the necessary compromises.

A friend of mine tweeted a commonly quoted phrase tonight.

I absolutely think that Apple are embarrassed about the v1.0 products they ship, in fact I think it is absolutely core to they way they approach building new products.

In my opinion, Apple take absolutely the right approach to this and when they do release a new product they are embarrassed about the right things and they compromise on **features, not quality**.

The original iPhone is a great example of this when it launched with no 3G networking, no native SDK, no copy/paste and many other things missing. The key point is that both the hardware and software that shipped with that first iPhone was extremely high quality (actually, I think my iPhone is less stable on iOS 4.x than it was on iOS 1.x) and polished. It would have been so easy to compromise on quality to sneak in a few more hardware or software features but they didn't. **This is how you should be embarrassed about your v1.0**.

I have wanted to blog about this since I read <a href="http://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/">Matt Mullenweg's original article</a> so thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/stuartfrisby/">Stuart</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/mcknut/">John</a> for having the conversation that prompted me to do it!
