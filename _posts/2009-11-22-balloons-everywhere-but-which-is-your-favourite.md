<h3>Thoughts on this</h3>
<ul>
	<li>There is a predictable skew towards the balloons included with the free version of Balloons!</li>
	<li>The star balloons are very popular, not surprising really as they are positioned front and centre when picking a balloon.</li>
	<li>Is it surprising that the bright green balloon is more popular than the classic red balloon? I thought people would go for the classic.</li>
	<li>The animal balloons don't seem to be very popular! Interesting because people really loved them in beta. (The cat being the most popular animal is no shock though, it is my favourite balloon type)</li>
</ul>
I am not going to try and read too much into this but I thought it might be fun to share ;)
