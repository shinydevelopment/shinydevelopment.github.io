### [iOS Dev UK](http://www.iosdevuk.com/) &mdash; <small>7th-9th September 2011</small>
A few days by the sea, with a bunch of Mac and iOS developers? I can't think of a better way to spend a few days away from the office. I am doing a couple of sessions, starting with a 2 hour "Beginners Guide to iOS Development" session on the first day and then talking about "Making Money with In-App Purchases" on the second day.

### [Future of Mobile](http://future-of-mobile.com/london-2011/) &mdash; <small>16th September 2011</small>
A platform agnostic look at, well, the future of mobile! I think this is going to be a fantastic day to get a great idea about not only iOS development but Android and Windows Phone 7 as well. I am presenting an "iOS Crash Course" there which is going to give a good overview of everything you need to know to build and ship a simple iOS app.

### [Future of Web Apps (FOWA)](http://futureofwebapps.com/london-2011/) &mdash; <small>3rd-5th October 2011</small>
Finally, I am super pleased to say that I will also be holding a one day "Introduction to iOS" workshop at Future of Web Apps. FOWA has been of the premier tech conferences in the UK and I will be running a one day workshop which will go into much more depth than is possible in a short conference talk and will be a great way to get up and running with iOS development quickly.

If you would like me to speak at your conference or event, please do [get in touch](/contact).
