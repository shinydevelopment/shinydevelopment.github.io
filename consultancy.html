      <h3>Testimonials</h3>
      <blockquote><p>&ldquo;As a leading provider of cross-platform email testing tools, we needed to enhance our software to allow clients to see how their emails would look on the iPhone. Being new to the platform, we relied on Shiny to give our in-house team the advice and guidance we needed to implement the functionality into our product. Their assistance was invaluable, greatly speeding up the process and helping us avoid numerous pitfalls along the way. Shiny went above and beyond the call to help us make sure the finished product was just right.&rdquo;</p>

      <blockquote><p>&ldquo;Shiny Development worked with us when we needed to create a Mac version of one of our applications. I am very pleased to say that Shiny Development did an excellent job advising us on how best to implement our features so that the application would behave as a Mac user would expect. The project ran smoothly and by the numbers. We got exactly what we needed and received a very thorough handover of the implementation. Needless to say, I am a very happy customer, and I would not hesitate to work with Dave and Andrew again.&rdquo;</p>
