      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>Shiny Development Ltd. (&ldquo;Shiny Development&rdquo;) operates the website <a href="http://shinydevelopment.com/">shinydevelopment.com</a>. It is Shiny Development&#8217;s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.</p>
      <h3>Usage Statistics</h3>
      <p>Like most website operators, Shiny Development collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Shiny Development&#8217;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Shiny Development&#8217;s visitors use its website. From time to time, Shiny Development may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
      <p>Shiny Development may also collect non-personally-identifying information from use of its software applications such as computer or device type, version of underlying operating system and version of the software being used.</p>
      <p>Shiny Development also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Shiny Development does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>
      <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
      <p>Certain visitors to Shiny Development&#8217;s website choose to interact with Shiny Development in ways that require Shiny Development to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Shiny Development gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, Shiny Development collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor&#8217;s interaction with Shiny Development. Shiny Development does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
      <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
      <p>Shiny Development discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Shiny Development&#8217;s behalf or to provide services available at Shiny Development&#8217;s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Shiny Development&#8217;s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Shiny Development will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Shiny Development discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Shiny Development believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Shiny Development, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Shiny Development website and have supplied your email address, Shiny Development may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with whatâ€™s going on with Shiny Development and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs and Twitter to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Shiny Development takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor&#8217;s computer, and that the visitor&#8217;s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Shiny Development uses cookies to help Shiny Development identify and track visitors, their usage of Shiny Development website, and their website access preferences. Shiny Development visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Shiny Development&#8217;s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Shiny Development&#8217;s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
      <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
      <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Shiny Development may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Shiny Development&#8217;s sole discretion. Shiny Development encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of Shiny Development&#8217;s sites after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
