      <h3>Custom Carrier Text on App Store Screenshots</h3>
      <p>Apple publish a set of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/appstore/AppStoreMarketingGuidelines.pdf">App Store Marketing Guidelines</a> which give plenty of guidance on marketing your apps, including the preparation of assets for the App Store.</p>
      <p>The <em>"Custom Photography and Video"</em> section of the document states:</p>
      <blockquote><p>If the status bar is clearly visible, make sure that the battery and Wi-Fi icons are full and that no carrier name is displayed.</p></blockquote>
      <p>We would agree with Apple that if <a href="/status-magic/">Status Magic</a> is being used to prepare screenshots for the App Store then the option to add custom carrier text should <strong>not</strong> be used.</p>
      <p>So why has this feature been added? Well, we originally designed this app purely for App Store screenshot preparation but we are aware that people are now using <a href="/status-magic/">Status Magic</a> for various other purposes and the feature has been added to support those users.</p>
      <p>For more detail on this, download the guidelines document directly from Apple below:</p>
