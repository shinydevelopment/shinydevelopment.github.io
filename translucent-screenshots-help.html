        <h3>Preparing a Translucent Screenshot with Status Magic</h3>
        <p>As of version 1.8, <a href="/status-magic/">Status Magic</a> now includes support for iOS 7 style status bars. As the status bars in iOS 7 are transparent this affects how you go about capturing screenshots ready for processing from your app. It is no longer possible just to overwrite the status bar area with a fully opaque new, perfect one as Status Magic can't tell what content was behind the original bar.</p>
        <p>So, instead of capturing a regular screenshot from your app...</p>
        <img src="/assets/images/status-magic-screenshot-bar-removed.png" />
        <p>... you now need to capture a screenshot with the background of the status bar in place but without any of the text or icons.</p>
        <h3>Solution... Integrate the SDScreenshotCapture class</h3>
        <p>Luckily, there is an easy solution to this problem! By temporarily adding code into your app it is possible to capture a screenshot which excludes the iOS status bar but keeps in the underlying background.</p>
        <p>We have <a href="https://github.com/shinydevelopment/SDScreenshotCapture">provided an easy to use class</a> which you can integrate into your project to allow screenshots which exclude the status bar to be easily taken. We suggest attaching the screenshot capturing code to a gesture on your window which is not otherwise used by your app but you can pick any method that works for your app to trigger the screenshot code.</p>
        <p>Once you have screenshots captured by the SDScreenshotCapture class they can be imported into <a href="/status-magic/">Status Magic</a> for processing as normal.</p>
