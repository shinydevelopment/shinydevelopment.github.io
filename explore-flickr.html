      </ul>

      <h2>Premium Features</h2>

      <p><strong>Mesmerizing! &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</strong><br />Simple and beautiful. An inspiring way to kill time.</p>
      <p><strong>A visual delight! &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</strong><br />Very nicely designed. Elegantly simple interface. Well done.</p>
      <p><strong>Lots of potential. &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</strong><br />Very charming app, the main screen load animation is elegant and large photos are beautifully displayed.</p>
